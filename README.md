<hr>

### Tools and Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Statsmodels
Pickle (for model serialization)

### Overview
This project aims to leverage unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically clustering algorithms and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, to segment customers based on their behaviors, preferences, and purchasing patterns. By dividing customers into distinct clusters and analyzing their RFM metrics, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer segments and tailor marketing strategies and product offerings to enhance engagement, satisfaction, and profitability.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of a comprehensive table with columns covering four key areas:

<b> Customer Information: </b>
- Demographic data such as age, education, marital status, income, etc.
  
<b> Product Purchase History: </b>
- Amount spent on various product categories (e.g., wine, fruits, meat, fish) over the past two years.
  
<b> Campaign Response: </b>
- Customer responses to marketing campaigns (AcceptedCmp1-5, Response).
  
<b> Purchase Platform: >/b>
- Channels used for purchases (e.g., website, catalog, stores) and frequency of website visits.

### Project Workflow
#### 1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Handling missing values, creating new features, and scaling numerical data.
  
#### 2. Customer Segmentation: Utilizing clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans, Agglomerative clustering, DBSCAN) to segment customers based on their behavior and preferences.

#### 3. RFM Analysis: Calculating RFM metrics (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) for each customer to assess their value and engagement level.

#### 4. Integration and Deployment: Integrating data into a database, developing cluster-specific marketing strategies, and deploying the project using Streamlit for interactive visualization.

### Future Scope
<b> Database Integration: </b> Real-time data updating and analysis for continuous monitoring of customer behavior.
<b> Cluster-specific Marketing Strategies: </b> Tailored offers and promotions for each customer segment.
<b> Price Optimization: </b> Determining optimal pricing strategies based on customer segmentation and RFM analysis.
<b> Predictive Analytics: </b> Anticipating future customer behavior and providing personalized product recommendations.
